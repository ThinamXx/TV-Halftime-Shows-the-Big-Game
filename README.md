# TV-Halftime-Shows-the-Big-Game
Hey there!! In this Project I have tried to answer the simple Questions about the TV, Halftime Shows and the Big Games. It will give you some insights about Pandas as well !

I tried to answer the following questions:


What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
